# ⚙️ Building a Serverless API with AWS Lambda & API Gateway

---

## Project Overview  
I created a fully serverless REST API using **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway**. This project enabled me to build an **on-demand backend** that responds to HTTP requests and retrieves data from a database — all without managing servers.

---

## Project Highlights  
### What I Did:  
- 🧠 **Developed AWS Lambda Function**: Wrote a Lambda function that retrieves data from a database.
- 🌐 **Configured API Gateway**: Exposed the Lambda function via a RESTful API using API Gateway.
- 🔗 **Created Resource & GET Method**: Defined an API resource and connected a GET method for data retrieval.
- 🧪 **Tested API Responses**: Verified responses using HTTP requests in the browser.

## Why Lambda & API Gateway?  
Combining **AWS Lambda** with **API Gateway** provides a lightweight, cost-effective way to build scalable APIs. It removes the need for server management, supports auto-scaling, and integrates natively with other AWS services — perfect for modern, event-driven architectures.
